Playwright feature:
     Open source
     Support multiple OS
     Support multiple languages
     Support multiple browser
     Auto-wait capabilities
     Default time-out for test = 30s
     Default time-out for expect =5s


When there is error pop-up which appears for few second, make sure to write locator at that time and Playwright
will automatically wait to perform action on that element.


When there is service based application and we use allTextContent() function it will not wait automatically, 
So, we have to call waitForLoadState('networkIdleState')

await always used with actions.
